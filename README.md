#1 Initailly, I wanted to make a interactive photo album. It was looking to be very difficult. SO, I decided to keep the photo element, and make it so they just switch out and you can rate it. 

#2 Photos are not working, they might be too big. I need a container for them to appear in to control the size. 

#3 I need to add more photos and the form is not added yet. The form is going to allow you to add comments.

#4 Coming back to fix the comment form
